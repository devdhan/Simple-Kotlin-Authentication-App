Project Title: **Kotlin Authentication App**
Description:
This project is a simple authentication app built using Kotlin for Android. It consists of three main screens: sign-up, login and homepage. The sign-up screen allows users to register by providing their full name, email address, and password. It performs client-side validation to ensure that all fields are filled correctly and that the password meets specific criteria, including a minimum length of eight characters, at least one number, one special character, one lowercase letter, and one uppercase letter. Once the user successfully signs up, they are navigated to the login screen.
The login screen enables users to log in by entering their email address and password. Similar to the sign-up screen, it validates the input fields to ensure they are not empty and that the email address provided is in a valid format. Upon successful login, users are directed to the home page.
**Features:**
* Sign-up screen with input validation for name, email, and password fields.
* Password validation criteria include length, presence of special characters, numbers, uppercase, and lowercase letters.
* Login screen with input validation for email and password fields.
* Error handling for empty fields and invalid email addresses.
* Smooth navigation between sign-up, login, and home screens.
**Technologies Used:**
* Kotlin
* Android Jetpack (Navigation, Fragment)
* Android Data Binding
